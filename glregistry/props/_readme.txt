This folder contains files that control how the OpenGL xml registry file is interpreted
into C# code and the associated file structure. Currently it's only aimed to pick up the
most recent complete OpenGL definition to leave filtering up to implementation desired.
All template files follow a pattern with new lines in the associated constant.
